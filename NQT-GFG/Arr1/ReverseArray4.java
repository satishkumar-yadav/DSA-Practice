 * Difficulty : Basic

  You are given an array of integers arr[]. You have to reverse the given array.

  Note: Modify the array in place.

  Constraints: 
   1 <= arr.size()<= 10^5
   1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
  
  Examples:
    1.
    Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
    Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
    Explanation: The elements of the array are [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1].

    2.
    Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
    Output: [2, 5, 4]
    Explanation: The elements of the array are [4, 5, 2]. The reversed array will be [2, 5, 4].

    3.
    Input: arr = [1]
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.

          // arr[left] = arr[right];
          // arr[right] = temp;

         arr[left]=arr[left]^arr[right];
         arr[right] = arr[left] ^ arr[right];
         arr[left] = arr[left] ^ arr[right];
         left++;
         right--;
       }

       return arr;
